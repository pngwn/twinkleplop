## 0.1.1
### Patch Changes



- [#43](https://github.com/pngwn/twinkleplop/pull/43) [`2b81a07`](https://github.com/pngwn/twinkleplop/commit/2b81a07d969ba6c79e0210bda36735a28781739b) Thanks [@pngwn](https://github.com/pngwn)! - Ship built JavaScript and type declarations. These packages previously resolved to their TypeScript sources, so importing them outside a TypeScript aware bundler failed with `ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`. `@twinkleplop/twoslash-svelte` pointed at a file that did not exist at all, and `@twinkleplop/core` declared a types path it never built. The `source` condition still resolves to source, so workspace tooling and type checking against sources are unchanged.
